Hey folks, Mike here with some sad news.

To the point: I've decided to cancel our scheduled 2025 events.

That doesn't mean Ludum Dare is dead, but I wont be running any events this year, nor will I be able to assist with things related to it (not for several months).

Without getting into the weeds, I made this decision due to a number of financial, medical, family, and health reasons. I value my privacy, but I will say
that financially I'm in a bad place, and I need to find work ASAP. I've actually been looking for work since 2024, and not to mince words, I've been screwed
over by the long drawn out hiring processes of several companies. Some of those rejections were my own fault though, trying to get concessions for the sake
of running Ludum Dare, and others ... I don't know, they probably disliked my use of the Oxford comma. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

To be honest, I'm not sure when I'll have everything sorted. It could be 6 weeks, it could be 6 months, I don't know. It's a lot, I'm a bit scared, but I do know
I'll be able to handle it better with fewer things on my plate.

I sincerely apologize for having to do this, but I need to take care of myself and my family right now.
